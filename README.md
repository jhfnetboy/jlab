#NLP Basic principles by jLab.tech
+ I am one of the guies who want to find something interesting,so i got the work NLP and want to do some jobs on it:)
+ maybe you will ask me :what is the NLP?,give me five ,nono,only three minutes,show you the way!


## NLP purpose and procedure
+ 1.linguistic problem,it a traditional Natural language analysis area,talking about the prep,verb,adj,etc word and meanings.
+ Using wiki official definition:Linguistics is the scientific[1] study of language,[2] and involves an analysis of language form, language meaning, and language in context.[3] 
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics
+ 2.translate linguistic into a formalism  using mathematical or more strict 
similar approaches.you can find scenario like this:Word segmentation,Part-Of-Speech Tagging,Stemming
+ 3.Make the strict ipmression into computer algorithm,like Trie trees,Aho-Corasick automaton,KMP algorithm etc. Then you will find a way chain procedure to make human language into a comptational formalism.
+ 4. Programming jobs,computer implementation,find ways more effective and more accurate to process the language and get the pure meanings and into signals to other system or became bigdata information.
+ 5.summery
+ we call step 3,4 NLP which cross Computer scince,linguistic and mathimatics.
+ machine translation and real character and philosophical language which wantting to replace diffrent languages like story of babel tower.
+ 语言的概率分析（语法、词法等），词长、语言几何系统，词频分析，数学是语言的最高境界；词的分布率，概率统计分析
+ four important area: Markov's Markov Model,Turing's algorithm computing model,Shannon's probability and information model,Chomsky's formal language theory.
+ Markov chain

## A real little project to show
